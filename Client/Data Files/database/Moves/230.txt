Can be used up to two times. During effect, whenever an opposing Pok�mon becomes active, that Pok�mon becomes poisoned if this attack was used once; or badly poisoned if this attack was used twice, unless it has Levitate or its current type includes Flying, Poison, or Steel. (Prevented by Safeguard and Substitute.) Effect ends when a Poison-type opposing Pok�mon without Levitate or the Flying type becomes active, if Magnet Rise is not in effect for that Pok�mon.

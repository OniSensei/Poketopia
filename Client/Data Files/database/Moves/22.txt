If this attack is successful, the effect begins. Effect lasts for two or three rounds, including the current round. During effect, user uses this attack during each of its turns and can't take any other action. [When user uses this attack this way during the last round of the effect, it becomes confused at the end of that round], unless it's already confused. Effect ends without causing confusion if this attack's type is ineffective against opponent's types [before the last round of the effect], if user is prevented from using this attack, or when user falls asleep, becomes frozen, or is replaced [before the last round of the effect]. If user is asleep, this attack deals damage and lasts one turn (doesn't cause confusion).

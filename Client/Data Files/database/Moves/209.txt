After this attack is used, if this attack is successful, if user has at least 1 HP, and if user's party has at least one non-active Pok�mon and the opposing Pokemon's party has at least one unfainted Pok�mon that isn't an egg, this attack causes the user to switch even if it cannot switch. (The new Pok�mon becomes active immediately. Effect of Destiny Bond and Grudge takes precedence over this attack's effect.)

If user's current type does not include Ghost or if user has Magic Guard, decreases user's Speed by one stage and increases user's Attack and Defense by one stage. Otherwise, user loses half of total HP (even if HP reduced would faint user) and at the end of every round, opponent loses 1/4 of total HP. This latter effect ends when opponent is switched. During effect, this attack fails against opponent. Fails either way if no target exists.

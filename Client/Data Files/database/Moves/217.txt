Effect lasts for five rounds, including the current round. During effect, the moves Heal Order, Milk Drink, Moonlight, Morning Sun, Recover, Rest, Roost, Slack Off, Softboiled, Swallow, Synthesis, and Wish are disabled for opponent. During effect, if a move or an effect of a move (other than Pain Split) would cause the opponent to gain HP, it gains no HP instead. (Liquid Ooze still works.) Effect ends when opponent is switched.

When opponent switches, if user chose this attack for use and opponent is one of user's opposing Pok�mon, and if user is not asleep, frozen, or about to skip its attack this round because it has Truant, and if user did not take its turn yet this round, user uses this attack with effectiveness doubled and skips its attack this round. (Can be used this way even if disabled. If this attack is used this way, user is considered to strike before other Pok�mon. If this attack causes the opponent to faint this way, the new Pok�mon at opponent's position becomes active immediately.)

Uses with no target the last move that targeted the user, was not prevented from being used, was not used by another move, had an accuracy check, and had a target of "single non-user", "all opposing Pok�mon", "opposing Pok�mon selected at random", "all non-users", or "no target". Fails if the affected move is Encore. The affected move is reset for a Pok�mon when it is replaced or one of its opposing Pok�mon is replaced. (A two-turn attack targets a Pok�mon on both turns of use.)

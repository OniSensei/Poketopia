Effect lasts for four to eight rounds, including the current round. During effect, opponent, during each of its turns, uses the last move it used before this attack was used, with no target, and opponent chooses that attack for use automatically and can't choose any other attack for use. Opponent may switch or flee. This attack fails if there is no affected attack; the affected attack is Transform, Mimic, Sketch, Mirror Move, Encore, or Struggle; if opponent doesn't have affected attack; or if affected attack has zero PP. During effect, this attack fails against opponent. Effect ends when opponent is replaced. At the beginning of opponent's turn and at the end of the round, if affected attack has changed, effect ends. At the end of the round, if affected attack has zero PP, effect ends.

[Pursuit]
Description=If the target switches out on the current turn, this move strikes with doubled power before the switch. Baton Passers still escape safely. When a faster Pokemon uses Pursuit against a U-Turner, the U-Turner is hit for normal damage; when a slower Pokemon uses Pursuit against a U-Turner, the U-Turner makes its attack, then is hit by Pursuit for double power, and switches out.

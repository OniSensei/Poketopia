[Future Sight]
Description=This move, even if the user and/or the target switch out, will strike the active target at the end of the second turn after its use. This move cannot cause a Critical Hit and its damage is calculated by using the original user's Special Attack and the original target's Special Defense. The move's damage is typeless so it never receives STAB and ignores weaknesses, resistances and immunities against this move's type. Only one instance of Future Sight or Doom Desire may be active at a time; because Future Sight is typeless and occurs at the end of the round, it also hits through Protect, Detect, Endure and Wonder Guard.

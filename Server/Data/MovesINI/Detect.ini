[Detect]
Description=Almost always goes first. The user is protected from all attacks for one turn, but the move's success rate halves with each consecutive use of Protect, Detect or Endure. If a Pokemon has No Guard, or used Lock-On or Mind Reader against the user during the previous turn, its attack has a [100 - move's normal accuracy]% chance to hit through Detect; OHKO moves do not benefit from this effect. Blizzard has a 30% to hit through this move during Hail, as does Thunder during Rain Dance.

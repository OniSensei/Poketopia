[U-Turn]
Description=The user switches out after use, even if it is currently trapped by another Pokemon. If the replacement Pokemon knows U-Turn and is holding Choice Band, Choice Lens or Choice Scarf, it will be locked into U-Turn, though Pokemon holding those items who don't know U-Turn can select their attack as normal. When a faster Pokemon uses Pursuit against a U-Turner, the U-Turner is hit for normal damage; when a slower Pokemon uses Pursuit against a U-Turner, the U-Turner makes its attack, then is hit by Pursuit for double power, and switches out.

[Sketch]
Description=The user permanently replaces Sketch with the last move used by the target. Sketch cannot copy itself, Chatter, Memento or Struggle. Transform and moves that generate other moves can be Sketched successfully, as can Explosion and Selfdestruct if a Pokemon with Damp is present. Healing Wish and Lunar Dance can be Sketched because they automatically fail when the user is the last Pokemon of its team. This move fails automatically when selected in wireless or Wi-Fi battles.

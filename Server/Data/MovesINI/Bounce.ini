[Bounce]
Description=On the first turn, the user bounces into the air, becoming uncontrollable, and evades most attacks. Gust, Twister, Thunder and Sky Uppercut have normal accuracy against a mid-air Pokemon, with Gust and Twister also gaining doubled power. The user may also be hit in mid-air if it was previously targeted by Lock-On or Mind Reader or if it is attacked by a Pokemon with No Guard. On the second turn, the user descends and has a 30% chance to paralyze the target.

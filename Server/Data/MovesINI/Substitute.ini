[Substitute]
Description=The user takes one-fourth of its maximum HP to create a substitute; this move fails if the user does not have enough HP for this. Until the substitute is broken, it receives damage from all attacks made by other Pokemon and shields the user from status effects and stat modifiers caused by other Pokemon. The user is still affected by Tickle, Hail, Sandstorm and Attract from behind its Substitute. If a Substitute breaks from a hit during a multistrike move such as Fury Attack, the user takes damage from the remaining strikes.

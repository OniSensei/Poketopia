[Chatter]
Description=Has a 1%, 11% or 31% chance to confuse the target if its user is Chatot. The confusion rate increases directly with the volume of a sound recorded using the DS's microphone; Chatot's default cry has a 1% chance to confuse its target and is replaced by the player's recordings. This move cannot be randomly generated by moves such as Metronome and it cannot be copied with Sketch. If another Pokemon uses Transform to turn into Chatot, its Chatter cannot cause confusion.

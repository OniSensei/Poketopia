[Trick Room]
Description=Always goes last. Attacking order is reversed for all active Pokemon for five turns; the slowest Pokemon moves first and vice versa. Note that move order is still determined by the regular priority categories and the effects of Trick Room apply only when Pokemon have chosen moves with the same priority. Using Trick Room a second time reverses this effect. This effect is also ignored by Stall and held items that may affect the turn order: Full Incense, Lagging Tail and Quick Claw.
